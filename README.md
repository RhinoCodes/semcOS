# semcOS

This is semcOS. With the Open Source community, we plan to write Mission Control software for major Space Agencies. 

semcOS is a derivative of Void Linux. We chose Void because it was small, light, without bloat, and it just worked. Furthermore, `sv` is a great way to manage Services (Void Linux uses `runit`). Furthermore, Void Linux has plenty of amazing documentation, as well as a strong community.

Available for x86_64, i386, and i686 computers. 

Details:
* Openbox as WM
* tint2 as panel
* st as terminal
... and thats it!
